#### How to start the app
- Check out the repo
- `yarn` or `npm i`
- Go to discogs.com, the settings page > developers and create a new app (after you have logged in). The "Callback URL" 
field should be set to `soundscrate://`. After you create the application, you should see a page which contains the 
"Consumer Key" and "Consumer Secret" tokens. Go ahead and create an `.env` file in the root of the project which should 
look like this:

  ```
  S_CONSUMER_KEY=Your Discogs Consumer Key
  S_CONSUMER_SECRET=Your Discogs Consumer Secret
  ```

- The default sort shows albums sorted by artist. If you have any folders you'd like to sort by title, add them to 
`folders_to_sort_by_title` in conf.js
- Make sure you have react native cli installed globally, and do `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` 
in the root directory of the project.
- Happy browsing!
